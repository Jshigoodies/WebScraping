Hi my name is Jason Shi
This is my Independent Study Project
So what have used is a python package called selenium
How did I learn this?
The documentation and videos, which were really easy to understand
and Stack Overflow was really helpful to find solutions and overall create a webscraping application for itslearning
So let's get started.
______________
www.itslearning.com  //something like that
When you want to open itslearning,
You first have to login.
So what you usually do is just type in your username and password and click the login button
Taking that into mind
I need selenium to type in these text boxes and click the login button
So i do ctrl + i
//finds element for text box
As you can see these elements have an id inside.
There are other parts in the elements like class name, tag name, text, or even by CSS.
But the most specific and accurate an elements is by id.
In this case both text boxes have ids'
If i type the wrong username, i can just find the red text, which is a html element, if it is present, i type my username again.

I then realized the first major error for logging into itslearning.
People could type in the wrong email but it can still be an existing email.

Usernames are only made up of only numbers. So you could accidently type the wrong email while it accepts it as an actual email.

The solution was the red text that appeared if i typed it wrong, so I just type it again but it happens for the password too.

________________________________
Now that i'm logged into itslearning, what I wanted to do next is to list out the options.
<show the code for def options()>
I was stil a novice back then, but this was a solution i came up with.
Since the tab bar up here has Home, Courses, Calendar etc.
I ctrl + i and noticed they all have li tags in them.
So i got the li tags and put them in a array
For each looped it
And for some reason the Text Home, Courses, Calendar had like 50 next lines in them.
So i fixed that with string methods such as strip and replace

__________________
so now that i have a list, I want to click the specific tabs, it is simply just finding the element and tell selenium to click on it, easy as that
I made a separate method for each tab to click each specific category.
____________________
Now these categories i did not really care about, they don't have any useful information.
So I mainly worked on the courses tab.
